# 🚀 Insertion Sort on Leo 🚀

## 🧠 Description

A fairly simple algorithm implemented in Leo for an array of 8 elements.\
The difference with the bubble sort algorithm introduced on the Leo Playground platform is that it uses a loop rather than directly setting all the changes.\
The loop goes through N-1 times and does some permutations depending on the iteration. 🔄

The program takes 8 signed numbers as input and returns them in sorted form. 📊

To run the program, you need to run the `leo run main` command with the values of the array elements. 🖥️
